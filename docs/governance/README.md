# GAP Protocol - Governance

This directory contains the rules, decisions, and strategies that govern the GAP Protocol project.

## Documents

### [RULES.md](./RULES.md)
Non-negotiable constraints and requirements for the project. These are the "laws" that must be followed.

### [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md)
Record of architectural and design decisions, including the rationale behind them and their implications.

### [universal-documentation-strategy.md](./universal-documentation-strategy.md)
The documentation philosophy and strategy that guides how we organize and maintain project documentation.

## Purpose

Governance documentation serves to:
- Establish clear boundaries for what can and cannot be changed
- Document why certain decisions were made
- Provide context for future maintainers
- Ensure consistency across the project

## Hierarchy

1. **RULES** - Must be followed, rarely changed
2. **DECISIONS** - Can be revised with justification
3. **STRATEGY** - Guides approach but allows flexibility
