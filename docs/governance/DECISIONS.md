# GAP Protocol - Architectural Decisions

Record of key decisions made during the development of GAP Protocol.

## Decision Log

### D1: Use UV Package Manager
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Adopt UV instead of pip/venv
- **Rationale**: 
  - 10-100x faster than pip
  - Better dependency resolution
  - Single tool for Python version management
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Requires learning new tool
  - Not yet universally adopted
- **Outcome**: Significant improvement in developer experience

### D2: Modular Architecture
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Split monolithic gap_protocol.py into modules
- **Rationale**:
  - Separation of concerns
  - Easier testing
  - Better maintainability
- **Trade-offs**:
  - More files to manage
  - Import complexity
- **Outcome**: Clean, professional structure

### D3: Pydantic for Data Models
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Use Pydantic for all data models
- **Rationale**:
  - Automatic validation
  - JSON serialization
  - Type safety
  - FastAPI integration
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Additional dependency
  - Learning curve
- **Outcome**: Robust data handling

### D4: FastAPI for Web Service
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: FastAPI over Flask/Django
- **Rationale**:
  - Async support
  - Automatic OpenAPI docs
  - Type hints integration
  - Modern Python
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Less mature than Flask
  - Async complexity
- **Outcome**: Excellent API with auto-documentation

### D5: Markdown for GAP Format
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Human-readable markdown over pure JSON
- **Rationale**:
  - Human-readable
  - Copy-paste friendly
  - Version control friendly
  - AI-friendly
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Parsing complexity
  - Less structured than JSON
- **Outcome**: Good balance of readability and structure

### D6: ZED IDE Integration
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: First-class support for ZED IDE
- **Rationale**:
  - User's primary editor
  - ACP protocol support
  - Modern IDE features
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ZED-specific configuration
  - Less universal
- **Outcome**: Seamless workflow integration

### D7: Browser Extension Architecture
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Chrome extension first, Firefox later
- **Rationale**:
  - Chrome has largest market share
  - Manifest V3 is stable
  - Most AI tools are web-based
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Firefox users wait
  - Manifest V3 limitations
- **Outcome**: Focused development effort

### D8: Dual Mode CLI
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: CLI works with or without API service
- **Rationale**:
  - Flexibility for users
  - No service dependency for simple operations
  - Better for scripting
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Code duplication
  - Mode confusion
- **Outcome**: Maximum flexibility

### D9: Archive Strategy
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Preserve all original implementations
- **Rationale**:
  - Attribution to AI contributors
  - Historical reference
  - Rollback capability
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Repository size
  - Potential confusion
- **Outcome**: Clear history and attribution

### D10: Universal Documentation Strategy
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Decision**: Adopt three-pillar documentation approach
- **Rationale**:
  - Serves both humans and AI
  - Single source of truth
  - Progressive disclosure
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Initial restructuring effort
  - Learning curve
- **Outcome**: Maintainable, discoverable documentation

## Decision Framework

When making new architectural decisions:

1. **Document the context** - Why is this decision needed?
2. **List alternatives** - What options were considered?
3. **Explain rationale** - Why this choice?
4. **Acknowledge trade-offs** - What are we giving up?
5. **Define success criteria** - How will we know it worked?
6. **Set review date** - When should we revisit?

## Reversal Process

To reverse a decision:

1. Document what changed since original decision
2. Propose alternative approach
3. Create migration plan
4. Update all affected documentation
5. Archive the old approach

*Decisions should be living documents - revisit them as the project evolves.*
