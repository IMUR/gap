I've attached a proposal document for GAP (Global Addressment Protocol), a concept I'm developing to solve a real problem I face daily: maintaining context and grammatical continuity when coordinating between multiple AI chat sessions for complex projects.

## My Current Workflow Challenge

I regularly work across multiple AI chats simultaneously - using different assistants for different aspects of the same project. When I copy responses between these chats, I constantly deal with:
- Pronouns and references that make no sense out of context ("the system we discussed" - which system?)
- Perspective shifts that create confusion (I/you/we becoming ambiguous)
- Lost context about what was previously discussed
- Having to manually explain background that was established elsewhere

## What I Need Help Building

I want to create a practical implementation of GAP that I can start using immediately. Based on the attached proposal, I'm looking to:

1. **Build a working prototype** that can wrap/unwrap messages with GAP metadata
2. **Create a simple transformation service** that adjusts grammar and perspective when sharing between chats
3. **Establish a method** for maintaining entity references (so "the database" in one chat correctly maps to "PostgreSQL setup" in another)

## Specific Implementation Focus

I'm particularly interested in developing:

- **For immediate use**: A FastAPI service or simple Python script that I can run locally to transform messages between chats
- **For browser-based chats**: A bookmarklet or browser extension that automatically adds GAP headers when I copy content
- **For Claude.ai specifically**: An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation if you're familiar with that ecosystem
- **For CLI tools**: Wrapper scripts for claude-code, cursor, or other terminal-based AI tools

## Technical Context

- I'm comfortable with Python, JavaScript, and basic web development
- I can deploy a local FastAPI service or use tools like ngrok if needed
- I'm open to using existing tools/libraries rather than building everything from scratch
- This needs to work with my actual workflow, not be a theoretical exercise

## Request

Please review the attached GAP proposal and help me:
1. Identify the simplest viable starting point for implementation
2. Write actual working code for a basic prototype
3. Suggest how to structure this for gradual enhancement
4. Point out any flaws or improvements in the protocol design
5. Recommend existing tools or libraries that could accelerate development

I'm not looking for high-level discussion - I need practical, implementable solutions. If you can write code that I can run today to start using GAP in some basic form, that would be ideal. We can iterate and improve from there.

What's the most pragmatic way to get a working version of GAP that I can start using immediately?

*Note: I'm actively using multiple AI assistants for this project, so your response itself may be shared with other chats using the very protocol we're building - a perfect test case!*
