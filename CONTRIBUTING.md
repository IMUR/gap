## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Python code follows [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) formatting
- Use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- Follow PEP 8 with 100-character line length
- Use type hints for all functions

### Project Structure

See [docs/governance/RULES.md](docs/governance/RULES.md) for project rules and constraints.

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Use pytest for testing
- Aim for high test coverage

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes
- Update CLAUDE.md if development process changes
- Keep documentation in `docs/` current

## Architecture Decisions

Before making significant changes, review:
- [docs/governance/DECISIONS.md](docs/governance/DECISIONS.md) - Architectural decisions
- [docs/governance/RULES.md](docs/governance/RULES.md) - Project constraints
- [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/) - Technical design

## Areas for Contribution

### Priority Areas

1. **Test Coverage** - The `tests/` directory needs implementation
2. **Browser Extension** - Firefox and Safari support
3. **Platform Support** - Add more AI platform transformations
4. **Documentation** - Improve guides and examples
