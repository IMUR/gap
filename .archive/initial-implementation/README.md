# Initial GAP Protocol Implementation

This directory contains the original GAP Protocol implementation files created during the initial development phase.

## File Inventory

### Core Implementation Files
- `script.py` - Original monolithic GAP Protocol implementation with all classes
- `gap_protocol.py` - Extracted protocol (duplicate of script.py core)
- `gap_cli.py` - Original CLI implementation
- `gap_fastapi_service.py` - Original FastAPI service
- `gap_mcp_server.py` - MCP server template
- `example_usage.py` - Original usage examples

### Template Files (from Perplexity)
- `script_1.py` - FastAPI service code template
- `script_2.py` - Requirements and setup instructions
- `script_3.py` - Browser extension implementation

### Browser Extension Templates
- `extension_manifest_json.txt` - Chrome extension manifest
- `extension_background_js.txt` - Background script
- `extension_content_js.txt` - Content script
- `extension_popup_html.txt` - Popup HTML
- `extension_popup_js.txt` - Popup JavaScript

### Configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Original pip requirements (replaced by pyproject.toml)

## Implementation Notes

### What These Files Contained

1. **script.py**: The complete GAP Protocol implementation including:
   - GAPProtocol class
   - All Pydantic models (GAPMessage, GAPSource, etc.)
   - Entity detection
   - Pronoun transformation
   - Platform transformation logic

2. **script_1.py**: Template for the FastAPI service, later extracted to gap_fastapi_service.py

3. **script_2.py**: Setup instructions and requirements list

4. **script_3.py**: Complete browser extension code that needs to be properly extracted

### Known Issues in Original Implementation

- Import paths were not modular
- FastAPI service had missing imports
- No proper package structure
- Mixed concerns in single files
- No test coverage

### Migration to New Structure

These files have been refactored into:
- `src/gap/` - Modular protocol implementation
- `services/` - Clean service implementations  
- `cli/` - Refactored CLI with enhanced features
- `extensions/chrome/` - Properly structured browser extension

## Historical Significance

These files represent the rapid prototype that proved the GAP Protocol concept. While not production-ready, they demonstrated the viability of the approach and served as the foundation for the current implementation.
