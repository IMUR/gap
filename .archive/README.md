# GAP Protocol - Archive

This directory contains historical implementations and superseded files from the GAP Protocol project development.

## Directory Structure

### `initial-implementation/`
Contains the original GAP Protocol implementation created collaboratively between:
- **User**: Original concept and specifications
- **Perplexity AI**: Initial implementation based on specifications
- **Claude**: Fixes, enhancements, and restructuring

These files represent the working prototype before the UV-based restructuring and modularization.

#### Attribution Timeline
1. **Concept Phase** (User)
   - `gap-protocol-proposal.md` - Original protocol specification
   - `gap-implementation-prompt.md` - Implementation requirements

2. **Implementation Phase** (Perplexity)
   - `script.py` - Core protocol implementation
   - `script_1.py` - FastAPI service template
   - `script_2.py` - Setup and requirements
   - `script_3.py` - Browser extension templates

3. **Enhancement Phase** (Claude)
   - Bug fixes in FastAPI imports
   - Project restructuring with UV
   - ZED IDE integration
   - Modularization into clean architecture

### `migrations/`
Records of significant project structure changes and migrations for future reference.

## Purpose

This archive serves to:
1. **Preserve History**: Maintain the original implementation for reference
2. **Show Evolution**: Document how the project evolved from prototype to production
3. **Credit Contributors**: Properly attribute work to all AI assistants involved
4. **Enable Rollback**: Keep working versions in case of issues

## Note

Files in this archive are read-only and should not be modified. They represent a specific point in the project's history and are preserved for documentation and attribution purposes.
